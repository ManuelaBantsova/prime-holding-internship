Assignment: Market Store Discounts
Explanation

For the solution of this assignment I created an abstract class Card, which contains
variables and abstract methods. Next, I created classes for each type of card -
Bronze, Silver and Gold. They extend the class Card so they have to provide
specific implementation of the abstract methods. The calculations for the discounts
are made in the constructors of the child classes. The constructors take as
parameter the turnover, the value of the purchase and owners name. If owner name is
not provided the constructor uses "Unknown". So when we create new card we can set
the name of the owner or we can do it later, using the method setOwnerName.

After that I created a class PayDesk. It has a static method called printInfo.
The method takes as parameter a card of any type(bronze, silver, gold) thanks to
polymorphism. This method checks the type of the card and prints information about
the card type, the owner, the value of the purchase, th discount rate, the discount
and total sum for paying.

In the class MarketStoreDemo I created instances of each card - Bronze, Silver and
Gold. Next I pass these instances to the static method printInfo to display the
needed information.
