Problem: Brothers in the bar
Explanation

To solve this problem, first I created an ArrayList from the input(which is array).
ArrayList has many methods, but most important has remove() methods, which I use
for the solution of this problem.

I created a static method, called calculateRounds. This method takes as parameter
an ArrayList. In the method calculateRounds there is a for-loop. In the loop I check
if there are 3 consecutive glasses of the same size. If the condition is true, then
I increment a static variable, called counter, to store the information about the
number of  the rounds. Next, I remove the 3 consecutive glasses from the ArrayList
and recursively I call again the same method. If the condition is false, then the
method returns the value of the variable counter.

To check if the elements of the array are valid I created a method, called
checkForValidValues, which takes as parameter an array and returns a boolean value.
